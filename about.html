    <p>HI THERE!</p>

<div class="content">
    <p class="myself">I&#8217;m Shreya Roy. I&#8217;m an undergraduate student(2017-2021) of Electronics and Communication Engineering at 
        National Institute of Technology, Durgapur.
    <br/>I was first exposed to programming in college and it grabbed my interest. Thereafter I put effort to learn various programming languages and build a firm grip. I am very fond of complex 
    systems that require critical thinking skills and logic.
     I am very passionate about programming and engineering as a whole. My hobbies include competitive coding, application 
    development, reading, drawing and travelling.</p>

    <p class="language-used">I have worked in different languages, frameworks, database systems etc. In terms of programming languages, I 
        primarily work in C++ and can also perform using Python, C, Java, MATLAB etc. I'm dedicated to growing as
         an engineer and as an individual.</p>
</div>
<p class="conclusion">I have performed some project works on my own. Also I have keen interest in web dsign and web development.
    I&#8217;m still improving my skills and earnestly looking for an oppotunity
    to work as an full-time SDE in an esteemed organisation. I want to work with highly efficient employees and enrich me with their
    co-operation and my effort.
